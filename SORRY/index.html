                    Mirai, sorry na po for leaving you hanging while I talked to my friend.
                    As much as I want to ignore them, I really can’t since I always reply
                    to them later than their chats… Please forgive me again, Mirai.
                </p>

                <p class="apology-body">
                    Let me bawi and lambing you please.. u can torture me, ignore me for a while,
                    punish me, or do whatever u want from me — I allow it!
                </p>

                <p class="apology-body">
                    I’m dead serious when I said na I wanted to make u smile and dislike it
                    when I’m making u mad. And the chance na nag tatampo or inis ka sakin is
                    for sure more than 75% that’s why I’m making this to show that I want
                    to apologize and show how much I love you.
                </p>

                <p class="apology-body">
                    I love you Mirai and I always will. Let me continue loving you
                    even when I make u mad… I’ll be here for u. LOVE YOU 💜💗
